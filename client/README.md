# Client

## Running this client with docker

Build the app with docker.

```bash
docker build -t cmsrewritefrontend .
```

Next, run the built container.

```bash
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:3001:4173 cmsrewritefrontend
```

This will run on port **3001** and not _3000_ or _4173_

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
